TP3 Update
Since my original project proposal, I have changed a couple of things. Previously, I had planned to have the player move instead of the background to simulate the player running. However, I realized that it would be more efficient to have the animated player staying in the same position and having the background move backwards to show a running movement. I also previously had planned to have the game only have one option where the speed would increase once the player collects 10 powerup stars. However, instead of implementing this, I decided to have 3 main levels: easy, medium, and hard and the player would be running increasingly faster in each level. For example, the hardest level would have the background moving at a relatively fast pace so that it is harder for the player to duck or jump over obstacles. 
Instead of having the powerups appear at a constant pace, I decided to make the powerups appear at random times since the difficulty level of the game is not based on collecting a certain number of powerups anymore. Lastly, in terms of the player having a certain number of lives, I decided that once a player hits an obstacle, it would die immediately. The game over screen also shows a stored “highest score” and a current score. The game over screen also features a key pressed function to go back to the start menu instead of directing exiting the game and then re-running the code to enter the game.
